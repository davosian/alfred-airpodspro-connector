# WHAT IS THAT

It's a **SHAMELESS** fork from [Alfred AirPods Connector](https://www.packal.org/workflow/airpods-connector). The original fantastic work is at [mariuskiessling/alfred-airpods-connector](https://github.com/mariuskiessling/alfred-airpods-connector). I was just not a fan of the icons and of the connect/disconnect functionality.

# MANDATORY SCREENSHOTS

![configure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/godbout/alfred-airpods-connector/master/resources/screenshots/airpodspro-configure.gif "configure")

![connect/disconnect](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/godbout/alfred-airpods-connector/master/resources/screenshots/airpodspro-connect-disconnect.gif "connect/disconnect")

# SETUP

The original documentation is great and works the same, so go have a look at Marius' repo: https://github.com/mariuskiessling/alfred-airpods-connector

# DOWNLOAD

Latest release available on the [release page](https://github.com/godbout/alfred-airpods-connector/releases).

# CREDITS
